## *AIM*

The main aim of this project is to get familiar with different languages and programming models and how they are fundamentally different from one another. 
*****************************
### *General Concepts*

The following aspects of a language must be kept in mind while using it:

#### 1. The Programming Model
   It refers to the way or style of writing programs. Some common programming models are:
   Procedural Oriented (C), Object Oriented (Ruby, C++),Functional (Haskell), Logic (Prolog).Hereby, a small description for each model has been provided:</br>
   - ***Procedural Oriented***: In such languages, the program code is written as a sequence of instructions mainly in the form of sub-functions. This has been derived from structured programming.Examples include C and FORTRAN.</br>
   - ***Purely Object Oriented***: In such languages, everything is compiled as an object. Cosequently, such languages become extensible too as one can define his own fucntions specific to even any constant( like a number)!. Ruby is one such language.</br>
   - ***Purely Functional***: In languages like Haskell, *everything* is considered to be a function. Here, functions also do not have any side-effects ,i.e., no function can alter the internal state of some variable.</br>
   - ***Logic Programming***: For these, PROLOG(*pro*gramming in *log*ic) is the best known example. Here, a program is executed by an “inference engine” that answers a query by searching these relations systematically to make inferences that will answer a query.</br>
   
#### 2. The Programming Paradigm
   From a wider aspect, this includes the imperative and declarative paradigms. Decalrative expresses the logic of             computation without describing its workflow whereas imperative programming computes with full control over the control flow. Declarative is more about telling what to do and imperative is about telling out exactly how to compute some expression.<br>The two common kinds of declarative languages are logic and functional languages.Procedural oriented is considered to be belonging to the imperative paradigm.

#### 3. Syntax
   Syntax of a programming language is like its spelling and grammar. It is a set of rules which define the combinations of symbols which will be considered as correctly structured.

#### 4. Type System
   The type system is a set of rules which assign a property called "type" to various components of a program. Having a good type system can help to reduce bugs.</br>
   Main categories:</br></br>
   A. *Strong vs Weak typing<*/br>
      The distinction is not strict. If typing rules are enforced more strictly, the typing is said to be strong and weak if otherwise. The terms are relative. E.g. Java is considered strong while Javascript is considered weak.</br></br>
   B. *Static vs Dynamic typing*</br>
      In static typing, the type is determined at compile time/time of writing the code. Examples include C, C++, Haskell, etc. In dynamic typing, type safety is verified at runtime. Examples of dynamically typed languages are Python and Ruby.</br></br>
   C. *Manifest vs Inferred*</br>
      In manifest typing, type has to be explicitly declared, e.g. as in C. While in inferred typing, the type is intelligently detected e.g. as in Python.</br></br>
   D. *Nominal vs Structural*</br>
      Nominal typing means that two variables are type-compatible if and only if their declarations name the same type. For example, in C, two struct types with different names in the same translation unit are never considered compatible, even if they have identical field declarations. In structural type system, equivalence is determined only by the type's actual structure. Examples of languages following this are OCaml and Go.</br></br>
   E. *Duck Typing*</br>
      It is similar to, but different from structural typing. An object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself. That is, if we have different types which have the same method, we can write code agnostically.
